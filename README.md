# Mech-105
Within this repository you will find three major functions we created and used throughout the spring semester of 2018
at colorado state university in mech 105. The three functions consist of falseposition, lufactorization, and simpsons 1/3.
The task behind the codes were to understand how these methods perform as well as coming up with a matlab code that 
performs the method for a variety of functions. 
Enjoy and use at your will.
